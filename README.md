# Code_Up_Repository
- A repository documenting efforts to study coding:
- Striving to boldly apply the latest libraries, techniques, and technologies for coding practice.
- Primarily utilizing PyTorch Lightning and Huggingface.
## Planned Tasks
- Implementing model architectures from scratch, covering the entire process from training to inference.
- Constructing architectures using pre-trained models.
## To be Implemented
- Transformers Architecture (Completed - Model)
    - PyTorch
    - [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- BERT
    - PyTorch, PyTorch Ligthning
